Best Practices for Using AI Code Generators
===========================================

AI coding tools seem like magic, but make a lot of mistakes

#. Assume their answer is wrong
	
	- it will appear correct
	- it will be very confident in its answer and try to convince you the answer is correct
	
#. assume their answer is stolen from a copyrighted work
#. set guidelines telling the AI which practices you always want it to follow (it will still sometimes ignore you)
#. the more confident the AI model is in its answer, the more likely it is to be wrong
#. think of them as a "smarter Rubber Duck"

#. assume their answer is wrong
#. they represent the average code on the internet.
#. You'll get more consistently correct answers with a language like Python that has a more established idea of what "best practices" means
#. You'll often get answers that look correct, but are not

How to use
----------

#. as a "quick start" to some new technology. Their answer might be 99% right, that 1% is a problem, but they still might have saved you 5 hrs of searching for the specific example you wanted to try playing with
#. as a "second set of eyes" on a problem. The answer might be completely wrong, but it might point you in a different direction than you had considered before
#. as inspiration (see previous 2
