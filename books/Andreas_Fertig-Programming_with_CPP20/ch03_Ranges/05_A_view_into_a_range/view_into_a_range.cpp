Chapter 3 | Ranges: The next generation STL

	Ranges are a new element of the STL that make using algorithms more concise and add the ability to write code in a functional style.
	
3.5 A view into a range

	Thanks to a component called a view, ranges are cheap, fast, and can reduce memory allocations.
	While std::string_view is specialized for strings, the views from ranges are generic.
	
	A view pulls the data only when needed making a view a lazy range that is cheap to create. 
	
	It must have move construction, move assignment, and destruction with a constant time.
	So all these methods should have O(1).
	Optionally a view can have a copy constructor and copy assignment operator if they satisfy O(1) as well.
	
	The primary goal of views is to be cheap and fast such that all operations have a constant time.
	Sometimes people refer to this as the pull model because the data is pulled when needed.
	
	They are only views of some other data.
	A view doesnâ€™t own its elements! We have to ensure that the data a view uses lives longer than the view itself.
	Otherwise, we have UB.
	
	auto results =	numbers | 
					std::views::filter(is_odd) | 
					std::views::transform([](int n) { return n * 2; });
