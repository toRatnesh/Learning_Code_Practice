2 Managing threads

    The C++ Standard Library makes most thread-management tasks relatively easy, 
    with almost everything managed through the std::thread object associated with a given thread.

2.3 Transferring ownership of a thread

    std::thread own a resource: each instance is responsible for managing a thread of execution
    Instances of std::thread are movable, even though they arenâ€™t copyable
    This ensures that only one object is associated with a particular thread of execution at any one time while allowing programmers the option of transferring that ownership between objects.

    The move support in std::thread means that ownership can readily be transferred out of a function
    Likewise, if ownership should be transferred into a function, it can accept an instance of std::thread by value as one of the parameters

    The move support in std::thread also allows for containers of std::thread objects, if those containers are move-aware

    One benefit of the move support of std::thread is that you can build on the thread_guard class from listing 2.1.3 (Waiting in exceptional circumstances) and have it take ownership of the thread
    it also means that no one else can join or detach the thread once ownership has been transferred into the object
