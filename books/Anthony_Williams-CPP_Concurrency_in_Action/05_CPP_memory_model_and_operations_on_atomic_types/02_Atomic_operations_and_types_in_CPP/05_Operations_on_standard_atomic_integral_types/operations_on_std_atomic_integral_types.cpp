5.2 Atomic operations and types in C++

An atomic operation is an indivisible operation. Itâ€™s either done or not done.
If the non-atomic operation is composed of atomic operations (for example, assignment to a struct with atomic members), you might observe or end up with a value that is a mixed-up combination of the various values stored.

5.2.5 Operations on standard atomic integral types

set of operations load(), store(), exchange(), compare_exchange_weak(), and compare_exchange_strong()
comprehensive set of operations available: fetch_add(), fetch_sub(), fetch_and(), fetch_or(), fetch_xor()
ompound-assignment forms of these operations +=, -=, &=, |=, and ^=
pre- and post-increment and decrement ++x, x++, --x, and x--

only division, multiplication, and shift operators are missing
Because atomic integral values are typically used either as counters or as bitmasks
additional operations can easily be done using compare_exchange_weak() in a loop, if required

named functions atomically perform their operation and return the old value, whereas the compound-assignment operators return the new value
