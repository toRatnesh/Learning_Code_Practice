5.2 Atomic operations and types in C++

An atomic operation is an indivisible operation. Itâ€™s either done or not done.
If the non-atomic operation is composed of atomic operations (for example, assignment to a struct with atomic members), you might observe or end up with a value that is a mixed-up combination of the various values stored.


5.2.7 Free functions for atomic operations

the nonmember functions are named after the corresponding member functions but with an atomic_ prefix
These functions are then overloaded for each of the atomic types

they come in two varieties:
	one without the tag and 
	one with an _explicit suffix and an additional parameter(s) for the memory-ordering tag(s)

	std::atomic_store(&atomic_var, new_value) 
	std::atomic_store_explicit(&atomic_var, new_value, std::memory_order_release)
	
all the free functions take a pointer to the atomic object as the first parameter
The free functions are designed to be C-compatible, so they use pointers rather than references in all cases

The operations on std::atomic_flag buck the trend in that they spell out the flag part in the names

*****
	The C++ Standard Library also provides free functions for accessing instances of std::shared_ptr<> in an atomic fashion
	The Concurrency TS also provides std::experimental::atomic_shared_ptr<T>, which is an atomic type
