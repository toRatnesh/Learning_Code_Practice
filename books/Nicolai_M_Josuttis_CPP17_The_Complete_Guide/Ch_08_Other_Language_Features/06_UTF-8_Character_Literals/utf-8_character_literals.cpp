6.  UTF-8 Character Literals
    Since C++17, C++ supports the prefix u8 for UTF-8 character literals
    u8 can only be used for single characters and characters that have a single byte (code unit) in UTF-8.

    both character and string literals now accept the following prefixes:
        â€¢ u8 for single-byte US-ASCII and UTF-8 encoding.
        â€¢ u for two-byte UTF-16 encoding.
        â€¢ U for four-byte UTF-32 encoding.
        â€¢ l for wide characters without specific encoding, which might have two or four bytes.
