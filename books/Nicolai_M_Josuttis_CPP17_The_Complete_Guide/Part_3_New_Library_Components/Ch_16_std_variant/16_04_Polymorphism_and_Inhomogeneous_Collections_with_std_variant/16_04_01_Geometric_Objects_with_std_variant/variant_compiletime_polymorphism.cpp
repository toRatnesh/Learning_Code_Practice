Chapter 16 std::variant<>
    std::variant<>
        a new union class
        supports a new way of polymorphism and dealing with inhomogeneous collections
        allows us to deal with elements of different data types  without the need for a common base class and pointers (raw or smart).

16.4 Polymorphism and Inhomogeneous Collections with std::variant
	std::variant enables a new form of polymorphism and dealing with inhomogeneous collections
	compile-time polymorphism with a close set of data types
	we can program that at runtime for different types different functions/methods are called (without any need for virtual functions, references, and pointers)

16.4.1 Geometric Objects with std::variant

	First, we define a common data type for all possible types
	using shape_variant_t = std::variant<Line, Circle, Rectangle>;
	
	This code would not be possible with runtime polymorphism, because then the types would have to have shape_variant_t as a common base class we would need a vector of pointers of shape_variant_t elements, and because of pointers we would have to create the objects with new so that we have to track when to call delete or use smart pointers
	
	called draw() functions donâ€™t have to be virtual
	If the type interfaces differ, we can use compile-time if or visitor overloading to deal with this situation
