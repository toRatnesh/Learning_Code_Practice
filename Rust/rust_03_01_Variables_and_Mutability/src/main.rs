    Rust is static typed language,
    We need to provide variable type at the time of variable declaration
    However, in most cases, the compiler will be able to infer the type of the variable from the context

    1. Variables and Mutability
	    immutable:  by default, variables are immutable
	    mutable:    use mut in front of the variable name to make them mutable

    2. Constants
        constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change
        can not use mut with constants
        constants are always immutable
        to declare constants use the const keyword, and the type of the value
        constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime
        naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words

    3. Scope and Shadowing
        Scope:
            Variable bindings have a scope, and are constrained to live in a block
            A block is a collection of statements enclosed by braces {}
        Shadowing:
            you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable
            the first variable is shadowed by the second
            it happens when using the same variableâ€™s name and repeating the use of the let keyword
            using shadowing we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name

    NOTE:
        Declare first:
            It's possible to declare variable bindings first, and initialize them later
        Freezing:
            When data is bound by the same name immutably, it also freezes
            Frozen data can't be modified until the immutable binding goes out of scope
